GNOME Data Analysis Software
============================

This package contains functions useful for magnetic field signal processing, with a focus on Excess Power search analysis and application on the data for the GNOME collaboration, see `Pustelny et al. (2013) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5524>`_. This documentation details all the available functions and tasks available through this software. Here are some example tasks that can be handled:

* Plot usual time series and spectrogram of magnetic field data.
* Perform excess power analysis and plot detected triggers in time-frequency map.
* Create artificial data for testing data analysis.
* Inject fake signal of different bandwidth and durations.
* Cross-correlation of continuous sine wave signals.
* Perform Allan Standard deviation.
